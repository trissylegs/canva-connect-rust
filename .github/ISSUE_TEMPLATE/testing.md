## Description
A clear description of what testing needs to be added or improved.

## Current State
Describe the current test coverage or testing gaps.

## Testing Goals
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Error handling test cases
- [ ] Edge case coverage
- [ ] Performance tests (if applicable)

## Test Areas
List the specific areas/functions that need testing:
- Function/module 1
- Function/module 2
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases

## Tasks
- [ ] Create test files
- [ ] Implement test cases for success scenarios
- [ ] Add tests for error handling
- [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Ensure test coverage meets project standards
- [ ] Add documentation for complex test scenarios

## Files to create/modify
- List test files that need to be created or modified

## Acceptance Criteria
- All identified functionality has appropriate test coverage
- Tests pass consistently
- Error cases are properly tested
- Test structure follows project conventions
- Tests are well-documented and maintainable
- Code coverage meets or exceeds project standards
